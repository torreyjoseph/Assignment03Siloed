There are 183032.19 cubic meters of water available for this town.
The average water usage per person over a 28.0 day period would normally be 259264.33 cubic meters.
Each person will have to conserve about 0.072332 cubic meters of water per day in order to not run out before the resupply.
Happy rationing!
